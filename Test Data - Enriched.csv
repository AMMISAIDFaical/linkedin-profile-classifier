Then I realized why the BYOA problem is unsolvable with current tools.<br><br>As Head of Compliance and CSO at a licensed crypto payments company in Singapore, I saw AI's potential immediately. We used it for everything - drafting emails, building strategy, even rehearsing meetings with regulators. ChatGPT was the only tool we trusted because it was the only one proven enough at the time.<br><br>But as I talked to peers at other regulated companies, I kept hearing the same pattern: teams were using personal AI accounts instead of approved company tools. Not out of defiance - out of caution.<br><br>The paradox is this: People don't trust company AI systems to keep their work private. They worry prompts will leave traces, that sensitive data will be visible to compliance or IT. So they use personal accounts instead, thinking it's more private.<br><br>Of course, that's worse. Now customer data is in personal AI accounts with zero oversight.<br><br>McKinsey found this everywhere: 8 out of 10 employees use personal AI at work without approval. Security teams call it BYOA (Bring Your Own AI). It's the new shadow IT, except every prompt is a potential data leak.<br><br>Our regulator warned us: watch out for customer data in AI. But there was no way to comply. There's no \""incognito mode\"" for customer data in GenAI. No masking layer. No way to use AI productively while protecting sensitive information.<br><br>CISOs are stuck in an impossible position:<br>• Ban AI → Teams lose productivity and use it anyway<br>• Approve personal accounts → Regulators ask questions you can't answer<br>• Buy enterprise AI → Too slow, too expensive, still no privacy layer for sensitive data<br><br>So I'm building NexusDesk: the AI workspace with the privacy controls and compliance foundation that enterprises actually need.<br><br>We're launching in Q1 2026 for non-tech teams at companies where data governance isn't optional. Built for the reality that teams need AI, CISOs need control, and regulators need answers.<br><br>If you're a CISO navigating the BYOA paradox, let's talk.<br><br>If you're on a team caught between productivity and compliance, join our waitlist.<br><br>---<br><br>📩 DM me if you're navigating AI adoption at a regulated company<br>🔗 Follow for honest takes on AI governance, compliance-by-design, and building in public<br><br>#AIGovernance #Compliance #DataSecurity #BYOA #EnterpriseAI #FounderJourney"",""location"":""10K followers Singapore""},{""profile_link"":""https://sg.linkedin.com/in/joepoon"",""name"":""Joe Keen Poon"",""about"":null,""location"":null}],""educations_details"":""Imperial College Business School"",""education"":[{""title"":""Imperial College Business School"",""url"":""https://uk.linkedin.com/school/imperial-business-school/"",""start_year"":""2021-10"",""end_year"":""2022-02"",""description"":null,""description_html"":null,""institute_logo_url"":null},{""start_year"":""2023-04"",""end_year"":""2025-04"",""description"":null,""description_html"":null,""institute_logo_url"":null},{""start_year"":""1995"",""end_year"":""1997"",""description"":null,""description_html"":null,""institute_logo_url"":null}],""recommendations_count"":5,""avatar"":""https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5603AQEg870sV5mEIw/profile-displayphoto-scale_200_200/B56ZoAXPm.JoAY-/0/1760942686059?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=XMSA1foZN_mRPwirGJM2IiOlG0l8OtGxLw-_nUxP0rY"",""recommendations"":[""Shamith Abeygunewardene “I've worked with Ben on a number of opportunities.

During that time, Frédéric developed and set up an ambitious strategy around the Group's product offering, redefining the objectives to be achieved and exploring how best to obtain them, an outcome which proved to be a winner. Frédéric’s input led to I'Car Systems being positioned at a higher technological level on the market, with a more complete product offering in compliance with the expectations of the clients, car manufacturers and automotive distributors, who are at the core of complex IT systems. We worked together to define marketing and communication strategies to deploy all of these new features. Our cooperation was always efficient and constructive due to Frédéric's ability to explain technical concepts in a customer-oriented manner. Frédéric knows how to rally the professional entourage around him in the projects he carries, whether it be the project team, top directors or managers. He knows how to share his vision, while, at the same time, remaining attentive and open-minded.”"",""Stéphane SURAUD “un directeur avec de vrais compétences techniques, technologiques tout en maintenant une vision stratégique adaptée au marché.
